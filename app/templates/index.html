            <p class="lead">
              We decided to create a song classification product that would
              accurately calculate whether a song belonged in a given playlist
              or not. Using specific attributes of a song, such as danceability,
              valence, and acousticness, we used machine learning techniques to
              predict if a song could be included in a playlist. Many different
              technologies were used to create this, such as:
            </p>

              <li>The Kaggle website to collect datasets</li>
              <li>The "pandas" library to manipulate and clean data</li>
              <li>
                Various external libraries for machine learning, such as
                "sklearn" and "tensorflow"

              A scatter plot is used to visualize the correlation between

              Notice the relationship between the three values. Happier songs
              tend to be louder, and sadder songs are more acoustic. You can see
              that as valence increases, our dots become darker, meaning that
              the songs are not very acoustic. The happiest songs tend to have
              medium to high volumes.

            <p class="todo">OVERVIEW, TALK ABOUT CHALLENGES WITH BIG DATA (CRASHING COCAALC)</p>

            <h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3>
            <p class="lead todo">
              SVM is a supervised machine learning model. It is a classification
              method which groups data points into different categories using a
              hyperplane. Because SVMs classify data point based on their
              location, this machine learning method requires data with
              clustering to perform well. To train an SVM, we used the SVC
              module from the SKLearn library. However, we found this to be too
              slow, and switched to the more optimized LinearSVC module. IMAGES PLS
            </p>

            <h3>Random Forest</h3>
            <p class="lead todo">
              Decision trees are a machine learning model that uses a specific
              condition on a "leaf" to classify data. If the condition is met,
              the data is passed to the right leaf, and if the condition is not
              met, the data is passed to the left leaf. Each leaf after will
              then repeat the process until the data is properly classified, or
              until the maximum depth is reached. <br /><br />

              Random forests consist of a “forest” of decision trees. They
              operate by first bootstrapping the data, which is basically taking
              random samples from the data, feeding the bootstrapped data to the
              decision trees until they finish, tallying up the results, and
              returning whichever result had the most tallies. Think of a jury
              system: each tree in the forest produces a “jury,” and then the
              votes are pooled and the winning product is returned. IMAGES PLS
            </p>

            <h3>Neural Nets</h3>
            <p class="lead todo">
              Neural Networks are a subset of machine learning that uses
              algorithms to understand underlying relationships of data. In this
              project, they are being used to understand the relationships
              between various attributes of a song and a playlist to predict
              whether said song belongs in a playlist. Within the code, the data
              is first split into random train and test subsets (80-20). From
              there, the classifier uses the test data to make predictions.
              After each run, an accuracy score was produced to assess how well
              the classifier was able to make predictions. To test and finetune
              some of the hyperparameters, the GridSearchCV algorithm was used
              to test multiple possibilities for hidden layers or alpha values
              and determine which combination worked best with the data. IMAGES PLS
            </p>

            <br />
            <p class="lead todo">
              In just 2 weeks, we were able to create a product that can (more
              or less) accurately predict whether or not a song belongs in a
              given playlist. With our limited team size and plenty of technical
              drawbacks, we still persevered and achieved an end result that
              satisfied our interests. Our project can be a stepping stone to
              greater things, such as true song recommendation or a genre
              classifier. Through this project we were shown the wider world of
              what is possible with AI. With our newfound knowledge and
              experience on data exploration and machine learning, this project
              is only the beginning of our AI careers.

                  I am a graduated senior and I have been coding for 2-3 years,
                  starting with Java. I joined AI Camp to learn more about Data
                  Science specifically and gain more experience before
                  college.</a

                  I've been coding in Python for about a year now as a rising
                  senior and I joined AI Camp to expand my knowledge on machine
                  learning and data science. I hope to major in Computer Science
                  and get a job in software development or artificial
                  intelligence.</a
